# Design-patterns

A design pattern offers a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given contex.  
There are 3 types of design patterns:
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural

Creational are used in creation of objects.  
Structural are used in class and objects organizing. So which class are and which are the links between them.
Behavioural identify how does the objects communicate with eachother.

|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Factory              | Adapter                      | Template method           |
| Singleton            | Composite                    | Mediator                  |
| Builder              | Proxy                        | Chain of respnsability    |
| Prototype            | Flyweight                    | Observer                  |
| Abstract Factory     | Facade                       | Strategy                  |
|                      | Bridge                       | Command                   |
