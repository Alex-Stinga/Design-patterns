# Design-patterns

A design pattern offers a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given contex.  
There are 3 types of design patterns:  
1. Creational  
2. Structural  
3. Behavioural

|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Factory              | Adapter                      | Template method           |
| Singleton            | Composite                    | Mediator                  |
| Builder              | Proxy                        | Chain of respnsability    |
| Prototype            | Flyweight                    | Observer                  |
| Abstract Factory     | Facade                       | Strategy                  |
|                      | Bridge                       | Command                   |
|                      | Decorator                    | State                     |

|                      |                              | Iterator                  |
